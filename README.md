# PL/SQL DDS PROJECT 4.1

This project is a university student data management platform which the university will be able to keep track of students and teachers. It is a distributed database system since it has multiple sites. The platform will work on other sites if one site becomes unavailable. We can see information from every branch.

This project was made for the Distributed Database Systems Lab(CSE4126) course for the semester 4/1 of AUST.
